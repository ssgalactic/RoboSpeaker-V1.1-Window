# RoboSpeaker-V1.1-Window

This code is a simple Python program that utilizes the Windows Speech API (SAPI) to create a basic text-to-speech application. Here's how it works and what you can expect as output:

The code imports the necessary module win32com.client, which allows interaction with Windows components using COM (Component Object Model) interfaces.

An instance of the SAPI.SpVoice COM object is created using the win32com.Dispatch function. This instance represents the speech synthesis engine that will be used to convert text to speech.

The program enters a loop (starting from line 7) that keeps running until the user decides to exit.

Inside the loop, the program prompts the user to input some text that they want the "Robospeaker" to speak. The user enters the desired text.

If the user enters 'q' (lowercase), the program responds by saying "Exiting from the program" using the speech synthesis engine, and then the loop breaks, effectively ending the program.

If the user doesn't enter 'q', the program uses the speech synthesis engine to speak out the text that the user input.

So, in simple terms, when you run this program:

It greets you and tells you how to close the program.
It enters a loop where you can input text.
If you input 'q', it says "Exiting from the program" and stops.
Otherwise, it reads out loud whatever text you input.
Please note that to run this code successfully, you need to have the pywin32 library installed, which provides the necessary modules for interacting with Windows components. Also, this code is specific to Windows systems due to its reliance on the Windows Speech API.
